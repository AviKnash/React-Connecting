CORS ISSUE:

install cors-django

//Django also has a ALLOWED_HOST built in settings.py
ADD LOCAL HOST AND GRAPHQL HOST(ONLY IP)

ADD corsheader to INSTALLED_APP

ADD corsheader.middlewear to MIDDLEWEAR(AT THE TOP) AND djang0.middle.common at bottom.

ADD CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS (Local_host only)

WRAP URLS.py graphql path with csrf_exempt.(IMPORT csrf_Exempt from django.views.decorators.csrf)

ERROR CHECK:

Installed material UI in worng folder(Check ./frontend/my-app/ not frontend)

Deleted second React app but not sure about node_modules. Check if error

url to graphql = localhost8000 but not /graphql.(Need changes?)


IDEAS AVI:

CHECK TO CHANGE CATS API BETWEEN POSTS

INCLUDE BOOTSTRAP COMPONENTS

CHANGE DATE FORMAT

PHONE COMPATABILITY LACKING

UPDATE USER(Email? Try console email?)

ALLOW USER TO ADD IMAGE?(Try Amazon S3 storage system)

ADD FRIENDS?(DIARY ENTRIES NOT AVALABLE?)





ADD loopable playlist
